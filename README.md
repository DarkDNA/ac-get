ac-get is a simple package manager for [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info/) It's primary features are:

  * Distributed
  * Easy to use
  * Self-Documented ( ac-get help )

It's also now open source, as this repo proves. To contribute please follow the Contribution Guidelines outlined below.

  * No additional packages may be added to the base ac-get repo
  * Patches should be sent to [The Mailing List](https://lists.darkdna.net/info/acg-devel)
  * No malicious code.
  * Must be self-contained, no external dependencies.

For now, I will selectively merge patches as they come by, but in the future I hope to give direct commit access to some trusted individuals.
