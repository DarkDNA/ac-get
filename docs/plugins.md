Title: Plugins?

Plugin ideas:

  * Package Directives?
  * Custom Repo Formats?

Things I will **not** add:

  * Custom ac-get commands
  * Anything else that modifies ac-get itself.

ac-get (the commandline program) is meant to be only a wrapper for the backing library, and frankly I feel it handles too much of the magic right now, and I intend to actively work on fixing that.
