# Custom Locations #

To install program files to custom locations on the filesystem, you must first make a file in your root
The file must contain a lua table.

For example, say you want programs to go into /programs libraries into /apis configuration files under /config
and the ac-get state stuff under /ac-get

Then you just need To make a file in the root called `ac-get-dirs` **BEFORE YOU RUN THE INSTALLER**.

The file must contain the following for the above example.

	{
    	binaries = "/programs",
    	libraries = "/apis",
    	config = "/config",
    	startup = "/config/startup.d",
		docs = "/docs",
		state = "/ac-get",
		["repo-state"] = "/ac-get/repos"
	}

The following keys are available for you to override:
