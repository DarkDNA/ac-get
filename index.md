Title: ac-get

`ac-get` is a simple package manager for ComputerCraft.

# Idea #

The idea is, instead of a single massive repository, content and script 
creators make their own repos, on their own servers and hosting things, and ac-get 
treats them as equals. In this vein, the only package currently in the "base" repo is
ac-get itself. Repos are fully documented in [the docs](/docs/)

# Can has? #

Yes, Yes you can! You can get it from [the download page](/download.html)

# What about the sauce? #

While previously I was too focused on getting it functional, and where I wanted it, I have since gotten it there, and now wish to share the source code with the world.
I ask that you do not make a fork without proper attribution, but for more of that legal mumbo-jumbo see [the license](/license.html)

The source code is available [on the DarkDNA gitlab setup](https://git.darkdna.net/amanda/ac-get)

# Halp it broked! #

Please report any bugs you find to me in #ac-get on esper, or on [the forum post](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/13821-ac-get-package-manager-for-computercraft/)
