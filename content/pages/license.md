# License! #

While I normally don't like to license my stuff, I have been told this is basically a suicide wish for any project, so I have chosen to use the MIT license for this project.
The full license is included below.

# Additional Requests #

While the license does not require it, I would greatly appreciate that any derivitive works, forks of this project, are linked back to this (the original).

# Actual legalese #
