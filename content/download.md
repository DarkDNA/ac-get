You have two download options to download ac-get, listed below:

# wget-alike #

You can get ac-get by using any wget-alike program, just point it at `http://ac-get.darkdna.net/install.lua` and download away!

# Oddstr13's bootstrapper #

You can also get ac-get by using [Oddstr13's bootstrapper](http://pastebin.com/AgZXgrb8) . This has the advantage of being on pastebin, so you don't need to use any other program to get access to ac-get. His program downloads, and runs, the offical installer, so it is just a matter of preference.

## ComputerCraft 1.55 and newer. ##

You can install ac-get using the `run` pastebin subcommand.

	> pastebin run AgZXgrb8

## Older ComputerCraft versions ##

Older versions of ComputerCraft don't have the `run` subcommand for the `pastebin` command, so you need to save it as a temporary file.

	> pastebin get AgZXgrb8 /ac-get-setup
	> /ac-get-setup


# Where's the sauce!? #
