I've just merged a feature into the ac-get beta channel that I am rather keen on.
It is the [Plugins Feature](/docs/plugins.html). They allow you to extend the lib-acg
runtime. This means that you can define additional package directives, and thus allow
the downloading of additional resources, for example.  

I plan to further enhanse this capability with more hooks for plugin developers,
depending on community feedback.  

The feature should be available to anyone who is [Beta Testing](/beta-tester.html)
ac-get.
