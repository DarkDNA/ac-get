Title: ac-get Â» Downloads

You have two download options, listed below:

# wget-alike #

You can get ac-get by using any wget-alike program, just point it at `http://ac-get.darkdna.net/install.lua` and download away!

# Oddstr13's bootstrapper #

You can also get ac-get by using [Oddstr13's bootstrapper](http://pastebin.com/AgZXgrb8) . This has the advantage of being on pastebin, so you don't need to use any other program to get access to ac-get. His program downloads, and runs, the offical installer, so it is just a matter of preference.

You can get it like this:

	> pastebin get AgZXgrb8 /ac-get-setup
	> /ac-get-startup
