Want to help make ac-get better? Great!

Beta testers are welcome to use this, however be forwarned that **Things WILL change** and that **This COULD brick your ac-get setup**

Now that we've got the plesentries out of the way, here's how you can help:


  * Run the beta installer `pastebin run BMg4Cd4P`
  * Test like crazy!

Please report any bugs you find to the [Development Mailinglist](https://lists.darkdna.net/info/acg-devel) or, if you're brave, submit a patch that fixes those bugs! Please keep in mind that not all patches will be merged, and that we reserve the right to deny access to the list.

That all said, go forth, and test the code!



Upgrading the Beta
------------------

During the beta, I may instruct you to update the beta. This can not be done using `ac-get update` as it's going to remain at the fixed version. In order to update the beta, you must:

  1. Re-run the beta installer.
  2. Remove the /startup and run `ac-get reinstall ac-get`
  3. More ways to come.
